# Quiz-app ( will be updated as the project progresses )

Quiz-app is created using following techniques:
- Node.Js
- JavaScript
- MongoDB

Basic rules:
- Each question has four answer options
- Only one of the options is correct answer
- In the future there is going to be time limit to answer in moderate and in hard difficulty settings
- Game is single player
- 10 random questions per game
- 3 different categories of questions


The app is two part program: backend and frontend.

Backend is made with node.js and mongodb using following dependencies: 
- Express;
- Nodemon; 
- Mongoose;
- Dotenv;
- xpress-validator;
- CORS

Frontend is made with html5, CSS3 and vanilla javascript. Accessibility of the frontend is one of the highest goals of this project.

There are going to be custom API calls between frontend and backend and needed data is packed with JSON. After the API calls are implemented then this readme is also updated.
